    " - Is everything bigger and sweeter in the US?\n",

    "To answer these questions we will be using the data source [Open Food Facts](https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts/data).\n",

    "The data source [Open Food Facts](https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts/data) is an open and collaborative database of food products from around the world. It contains information from product labels visible on product packages. This is a data source which has been built up by volunteers from around the world.\n",

Therefore, our conclusions above can only serve as an indication.\n",

    " - Compare other nutrient types (e.g. carbs, proteins, etc)\n",
